 Customer Insights Analysis
Overview
Retail businesses generate vast amounts of data daily. This project demonstrates how to analyze a retail dataset to uncover actionable customer insights, optimize operations, improve retention, and drive revenue.
 
Problem Statement
Retailers face several challenges:
•	Identifying high-value customers: Often hidden among transactional data.
•	Improving customer retention: Lack of insights into why customers churn.
•	Understanding product performance: Difficulty in determining top-performing and underperforming products.
•	Optimizing marketing strategies: Ineffective campaigns due to poor segmentation.
 
Solution Approach
1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
•	Removed rows with missing or invalid data (CustomerID, InvoiceNo, etc.).
•	Excluded negative quantities to filter returns or errors.
•	Formatted dates for trend analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Segmented customers based on total spend: 
o	Low Spend (< $100): Budget-conscious buyers.
o	Medium Spend ($100 - $500): Regular customers.
o	High Spend (> $500): Top revenue contributors.
•	Created visualizations for key metrics (e.g., top customers, sales by country).
3. Advanced Analytics
•	Cohort Analysis: Tracked customer retention over time.
•	Product Performance Analysis: Identified top-performing products by revenue.
4. Data Visualization
•	Clear, actionable visuals using bar charts, heatmaps, and pie charts to communicate insights effectively.
 
Features
1.	Customer Segmentation 
o	Classify customers into Low, Medium, and High spenders.
2.	Retention Analysis 
o	Understand customer drop-off trends.
3.	Product Insights 
o	Identify top and underperforming products for inventory optimization.
4.	Regional Sales Insights 
o	Analyze sales trends by country or region.
 
Benefits
•	High-Value Customer Targeting: Personalize offers for top spenders.
•	Improved Retention: Engage customers at risk of churn.
